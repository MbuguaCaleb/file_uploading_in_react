**PROJECT CONCEPT**

```
Bootstrap has been used for the the front end UI in react.

The project has a progress bar included as well.

```

**File Uploads with React**

```
Major focus in this application is the front end.
As for the backend its all about having an endpoint that we hit and which in turn does upload the file.

Express has been used in the backend.

Along with a package in express called express file uploads.

We are also going to use React hooks as well as async await practices.

```

**Express Dependencies**

```
(a)npm i express
(b)npm i express-fileupload
(c)npm i -D nodemon concurrently
concurrently will help me to run react and express concurrently

```

**Client side with React**

```
(a)npx create-react-app client

(b)npm i axios

```

**React Fragments**

```
Comes whereby you have a list of related components but you do not wish to add extra nodes to the D.O.M

```

**React Hooks**

```
Reminder of how hooks work

const [filename, setFilename] = useState("Choose File");

part(a)const [filename, setFilename] = filename is the state...setFilename is called to set the state.
part(b )useState("Choose File"); {sets the value of the state}

Hooks are a very effective way of setting the state.

```

**Abstracted concepts**

```
In react after the return in jsx you render HTML or alternatively components.

custom Functions are written above the return and they can be called from the return as either events in the jsx way.

The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest.In my case i have used it to send data from the form to the backend.

```

**Adding a proxy**

```
Adding a proxy within package.json the references tha backend url
helps us not keep on specifying it from the front end side when making the request to the backend.

```

**Javascript Form Data**

```
The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest.

It is primarily intended for use in sending form data, but can be used independently from forms in order to
transmit keyed data.


```

**Dev Dependencies**

```
npm i -D nodemon concurrently

Helps me run the backend and front end concurrenty
